to push an image to docker hub
-first tag an image on file to the repo name
   eg you have an image like ubuntu-git (you installed git on ubuntu:latest)
      and you want to save it to your docker repo (userid/repo-name:tag)
   docker tag ubuntu-git ha-li/ubuntu-git:latest

-then docker images should show your new image as ha-li/ubuntu-git   
 push that image

   docker  push ha-li/ubuntu-git:latest
